# About Me

**Name:** Reese Flowers

**Hometown:** Chicago, Il

**Prior IT Experience:**

As a child, I found interest in taking apart all kinds of electronics such as tv's, video game systems, microwaves, and etc just to see what was inside. If I was able to fix the issue, it was a plus. If not, I still got to learn new things which was exciting for me in and of itself. In my teenage years, I went to a vocational high school, where I elected to learn about electronics. Not only did I learn about the things that I had taken apart in the past, I excelled in my studies. In my early 20's I was selected for the 2nd cohort of Year Up Chicago where I learned about hardware, html coding, and other professional skills. I did very well there too, and even had my picture posted on a wall (along with a few others) at the entrance of their second location. Some time after that I learned a little about networking.

you in this field.)

**Career Plans:**

After completing the cybersecurity course, I aim to become a Security or Cloud Operations Analyst to gain experience and build my skillset. Long term, I hope to become a Cloud Security Architect within the private sector. I have plans to continue my studies in the cloud space with AWS once I am done with the course.

roles or industries are you aiming for?)

**Proud Project/Task:**

Recently, I had to prepare for an assessment to qualify for the cybersecurity course. It contained a lot of studies related to the Comptia Tech+ certification and I only had about a week to prepare. With only a limited amount of time, I was able to watch over 10 hours of video, prepare and review notes. I utilized Chatgpt for practice exams on each domain and even used it as a tutor to explore concepts that were complex for me until it made sense. I was also able to draw upon some of the knowledge that I had gained in the past. I put my mind on passing the assessment with the best score that I could, and received a 44 out of 45. In a sense, it felt like validation to me that I can still do this.
