# About Me
**Name:** Reese Flowers
**Hometown:** Chicago, Il
**Prior IT Experience:**
As a child, I found interest in taking apart all kinds of electronics such as tv's, video game systems, microwaves, and etc just to see what was inside. If I was able to fix the issue, it was a plus. If not, I still got to learn new things which was exciting for me in itself. In my teenage years, I went to a vocational high school, where I elected to learn about electronics. Not only did I learn about the things that I had taken apart in the past, I excelled in my studies. In my early 20's I was selected for the 2nd cohort of Year Up Chicago where I learned about hardware, html coding, and other professional skills. I did very well there too, and even had my picture posted on a wall (along with a few others) at the entrance of their second location. Some time after that I learned a little about networking.
